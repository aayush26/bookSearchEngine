Book Search and Recommendation using Latent Semantic Indexing (library gensim)

The problem statement is stated as : The traditional method for searching a book usually requires author or title and genre. Consider cases where these fields for the book are unknown to the user but have an idea about the overview of the book.    

Implementation : In such cases, this overview can be used as a query of relevant keywords to search a book. The result will be based on the semantic relationship between the search query and the short description of the book.   

Based on Flask framework
